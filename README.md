# Hi, there Widzmarc Jean Nesly Phelle here..!ðŸ‘‹
## I am a full-stack web developer.

I am a software engineer with 1+ years of experience applying industry standards for web development software. I had created a custom linter for ruby files and always working on other side projects.

I have created a fair amount of projects related to the front end and back end. And earn a crazy amount of hours only people who are passionate about a subject are willing to spend to craft their skills :)

I also love spending some time on HackerRank hunting for coding challenges.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: widzmarc@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I prefere coding early in the morning :)
