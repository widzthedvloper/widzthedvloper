# Widzmarc Jean Nesly PhelleðŸ‘‹
Hey there! Iâ€™ve got a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a solid three years in web development. But what really lights my fire? AI, ML, and big data, they're my jam. Beyond the nitty-gritty tech, Iâ€™m fascinated by how tech and culture vibe together, you know? Itâ€™s like this dance between innovation and society, and Iâ€™m all about figuring out how they click. My thing? Connecting the dots between tech leaps and how they shape our world.
